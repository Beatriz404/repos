# framework-base
# --------------
#
# The base library provides implementations for some of the default
# sessions, such as Shell, Meterpreter, DispatchNinja, and VNC.  These
# sessions are used by modules that come pre-packaged with the default
# module distribution of Metasploit and are depended on by their
# respective payloads.
#
# Beyond providing the default sessions, framework-base also provides
# a wrapper interface to framework-core that makes some of the tasks,
# such as exploitation, into easier to manage functions.

# framework-base depends on framework-core
